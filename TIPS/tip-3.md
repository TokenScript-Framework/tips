# TIP-3: Intrinsic cards

## Simple summary

Add built-in cards that are bundled with the TokenScript engine, 
and can be enabled/disabled by TokenScript developers through simple feature flags.

## Abstract

Tokens using standards like erc-20, erc-721, erc-1155 all have similar functionality, for instance the transfer action. 
Similarly, many TokenScript applications have the potential to work across multiple token collections or even all 
collections belonging to specific token standards. Some examples of this are our token-to-token messaging system and the 
DOOAR DEX.

## Motivation

We have previously used TokenScript template.
